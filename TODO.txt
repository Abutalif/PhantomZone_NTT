        2. Looking for primitive roots.
        3. Modular operations.
    4. Add test for default.
        1. Polynomial multiplication.
        2. [DONE] Forward - Inverse check.

2. Benchmarking: The same as tests, but aligned to provided benchmarking criterions.

3. Lazy-calculation (2q) optimization:
    1.

4. CPU instructions optimization:
    1.

6. README - Explain what you have done, what resources used, why chose certain implementations.
    1. Add used papers.

7. Refactoring:
    1. Restructure modules.
    2. Add "assert!()" where needed - modulus ops, builder, etc.
    3. Separate butterfly logic.
    4. [DONE] Implement default.
